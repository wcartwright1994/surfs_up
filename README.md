Performing analysis to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round based on weather patterns in two months.

**Overview of the Statistical Analysis**
The purpose of this statistical analysis is to:
1. Compile statistical measures for June and December weather based on the sqlite data provided.
2. Determine the differences in the historical weather based on the statistical measures.
3. Provide additional queries that must be performed to provide an appropriate recommendation. 

**Statistical Analysis Results**
The key differences in the historical weather since 2010 between June and December are:
1. The average temperature in December is approximately 4 degrees (5%) lower than in June.
2. The minimum temperature in December is approximately 8 degrees (13%) lower than in June.

**Statistical Analysis Summary**
Based on the temperature analysis performed and data provided, the temperatature in June and December do not show a large difference. Based on this measure only, it appears that the ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round. 

However, additional queries should be performed to determine:
1. If there exists a significant variance in the number of tourists that visit the island during these periods. Querying data on average airline ticket prices and seat fill-rates could be used to assist in this analysis. 
2. The number of employees and hours of operation (variable costs) for the ice cream shop during peak and off months. Querying data on historical sales and sales at comparable businesses in the food and beverage industry could be useful in this analysis.
